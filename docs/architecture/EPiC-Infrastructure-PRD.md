# EPiC Infrastructure Management System - Technical PRD

**Version:** 1.0
**Date:** September 2025
**Status:** Planning Phase

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

The EPiC Infrastructure Management System is a centralized Terraform-based infrastructure-as-code solution designed to manage AWS resources across multiple projects and environments. This system will replace manual infrastructure management with automated, version-controlled, and reusable infrastructure components.

### Key Objectives

-   **Centralize** infrastructure management across all EPiC projects
-   **Standardize** AWS resource provisioning and configuration
-   **Automate** deployment processes and reduce manual errors
-   **Optimize** costs through shared resources and right-sizing
-   **Enhance** security through consistent policies and compliance

---

## 📋 Problem Statement

### Current State Challenges

1. **Manual Infrastructure Management**: IAM policies, S3 buckets, and EC2 resources created manually through AWS Console
2. **Scattered Resources**: Each project manages its own infrastructure independently
3. **Inconsistent Security**: Different security configurations across projects
4. **Cost Inefficiency**: Duplicate resources and poor resource utilization
5. **No Version Control**: Infrastructure changes are not tracked or reversible
6. **Limited Scalability**: Difficult to replicate setups for new projects

### Pain Points

-   ❌ **Time-consuming setup** for new projects (2-3 days manual work)
-   ❌ **Human errors** in AWS Console configurations
-   ❌ **No disaster recovery** for infrastructure itself
-   ❌ **Difficult compliance auditing** without infrastructure documentation
-   ❌ **Resource sprawl** and unexpected AWS costs

---

## 🎯 Solution Overview

### Vision Statement

_"A unified, automated, and scalable infrastructure management system that empowers teams to deploy secure, cost-effective AWS resources with zero manual configuration."_

### Core Principles

1. **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure defined in version-controlled Terraform
2. **Modularity**: Reusable components across projects and environments
3. **Security by Default**: Built-in security best practices and compliance
4. **Cost Optimization**: Shared resources and automated right-sizing
5. **Developer Experience**: Simple, self-service infrastructure provisioning
